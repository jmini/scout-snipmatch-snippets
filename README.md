scout-snipmatch-snippets
========================

Forked from the official [org.eclipse.recommenders.snipmatch.snippets repository](http://git.eclipse.org/c/recommenders/org.eclipse.recommenders.snipmatch.snippets.git/) to work on some [Eclipse Scout](http://www.eclipse.org/scout) specific snippets.

With version `2.1.11.v20141112-1056` of Snipmatch (Mars M3), it is possible to work with multiple Snippet repositories. 
On branch `format-5` (the corresponding branch) the snippets already defined in *Eclipse Code Recommenders Snippet Repository* have been deleted from this repository. Otherwise they were defined twice.
